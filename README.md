SublimePuppet
==================================

[Puppet](puppetlabs.com) highlighting, snippets and completion for Sublime Text 2 & 3.  Now with windows parsing support.

### Plugin installation

#### Package Manager

First, install the Package Control plugin, instructions here: http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control.

Once you install Package Control, restart ST2 and bring up the Command Palette (`Command+Shift+P` on OS X, `Control+Shift+P` on Linux/Windows). Select "Package Control: Install Package", wait while Package Control fetches the latest package list, then select SublimeLinter when the list appears. The advantage of using this method is that Package Control will automatically keep SublimePuppet up to date with the latest version.

#### Manual

**With Git:** Clone the repository in your Sublime Text "Packages" directory:

    git clone https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter.git


The "Packages" directory is located at:

* OS X:

        ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/

* Linux:

        ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/

* Windows:

        %APPDATA%/Sublime Text 2/Packages/

**Without Git:** Download the latest source from [here](https://github.com/russCloak/SublimePuppet/archive/master.zip) and copy the `SublimePuppet` folder to your Sublime Text "Packages" directory.
